 # Weather-Site
 
Recently Learned Api Handling, so tried implementing my knowledge and what's better than a weather webApp for this purpose.
So completed this last week
This Web application does the following :
▶ Access current weather data for any location including over 200,000 cities,
▶ Hourly Forecast For 24 hours, so you can plan your day better
▶ Provides you with next 7 days forecast data with all the important details.
▶ Automatically detects your location, so to provide you with the info that matters. 
▶ Easy access to cities marked favourite

Tools and technologies used : 
⭐ Html
⭐ Css
⭐ Vanila Js
⭐ Chart js
⭐ Openweathermap Api
⭐ Geolocation Api to detect real time location
⭐ Git & Github for version control
⭐ Netlify and its serverless functions for secure Hosting
